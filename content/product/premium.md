What?
------------
We are introducing Premium account. From now on scheduled deliveries are available only to Premium users.
 
Why?
----
Well, the truth is that we can't afford running the service for free anymore. Keendly has always been free but unfortunately, servers are not and to keep the service alive, we need to start getting some money.
 
How much?
---------
Premium plan will cost **3â‚¬ monthly**. After signing up for Premium, there is gonna be **7 days of free trial period**, with access to Premium features. First payment will happen when trial period ends. Subscription can be cancelled at any time.
 
Can I keep using Keendly without paying?
----------------------------------------
Sure, the only feature that is gonna require Premium account are scheduled deliveries. Everything else, like manual deliveries, app, interactive ebooks etc, will remain free.

I have more questions
