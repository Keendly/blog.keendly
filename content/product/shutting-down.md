Dear Keendly user

We are shutting down Keendly. This is something we really wanted to avoid, but our plan didn't work as we hoped it for.

As you might know, couple of weeks ago we introduced Premium accounts, unfortunately we didn't receive as many premium subscriptions as we needed to keep Keendly alive.

Therefore, we will be stopping the entire service by the end of the month. Everybody that subscribed for Premium, will be refunded after that date.

It was a great journey. We really learned a lot. We want to thank you everybody that ever used our service, that submitted positive and espacially negative feedback :-) You are great!

Thank you and see you later,  
Keendly Team
