Let me introduce Keendly, a service that allows you to enjoy content from your favorite websites as you would enjoy a book.

It won't be anything new if I say that we were never surrounded by as much information as we are now. Notifications about new content are coming from multiple channels all the time. We are not left alone though. RSS readers, social media feeds are helping us to organize, services like Pocket or Readability are helping to focus on the actual content. But it is still very difficult to keep up and many of us had to give up and reduce number of subscriptions.

On the other hand, it is not about the quantity, or at least not only. There is also quality. Fortunately, internet is full of high quality content as well. Content that requires us to be fully focused. Content that make us willing to sacrifice quantity in favor of quality. But all the incoming messages do not help to focus. Everyone has his own way to solve that issue, different things work for different people.

But do you experience the same issue when reading a book? Books give the sensation of being one to one with the story. Well, not all of them. But it is rare to give up on a book after reading few sentences as we are used to do on the internet.

This is where the idea of serving websites in the form of an ebook was born. Service that will convert the articles into the personalized ebook, that you can read on your E-Reader, just as you would read a book. You can take them offline, you can come back whenever you want.

*Guess what*, it is there! Keendly will deliver content from your RSS reader right to your Kindle.
Let me show you how it works:

* Go to [Keendly](https://app.keendly.com) and log in with your RSS reader account
  ![Log in](/img/meet-keendly/login.png)
