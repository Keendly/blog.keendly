What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)? 
---------------

It pretty much is a way to install a web application on a mobile phone, to deliver native mobile experience without worrying about an app store, upgrades etc. It is served from the cloud, but thanks to caching also availlable offline.

When you first visit _app.keendly.com_, your browser with ask you whether you want to add Keendly to your Home Screen, few seconds after clicking the button, you will see a new app installed:
