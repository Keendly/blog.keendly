Few days ago we released first of many (hopefully) features that we call *interactive magazines*.  
You can now find two links just below the article's title. They allow you to:

* __Star article__  
  For some readers (NEWSBLUR) it is called *save* instead.  
  It will simply mark the article as saved for later.

* __Mark as read__  
  As you suspect, it will mark the article as read in your reader.  
  **NOTE:** link is available only if you didn't choose to mark the articles as read automatically.

These are the first *interactions* we implemented. We have many ideas for more, like sharing an article on Facebook/Twitter. Or saving it to Pocket/Evernote/Instapaper.
If you would like to see some other, let us know.

We hope you all will find it useful. Give us a shout if you have any other ideas to improve Keendly!
